## About

CMR-GraphQL is an API developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) to search against [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) concept metadata using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Application Installation

Before running the application you'll want to ensure that all necessary packages are installed by running:

    npm install

CMR-GraphQL uses a few environment variables for configuring runtime options:

|Variable Name|Default|Description|
|-|:-:|-|
|CMR_ROOT_URL||URL to ping when retrieving metadata from CMR e.g. https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov|
|MMT_ROOT_URL||URL to ping when retrieving metadata from MMT e.g. https://mmt.earthdata.nasa.gov|
|DRAFT_MMT_ROOT_URL||URL to ping when retrieving draft metadata from Draft MMT e.g. https://draftmmt.earthdata.nasa.gov|
|LAMBDA_TIMEOUT|30|Number of seconds to set the Lambda timeout to.|

### Serverless Framework

The local development environment for the static assets can be started by executing the command below in the project root directory:

    serverless offline

This will run the application at [http://localhost:3003/dev/api](http://localhost:3003/dev/api)

## Usage

Currently, this API supports searching and retrieving data for [Collections](#collections), [Granules](#granules), [Services](#services), [Subscriptions](#subscriptions), [Tools](#tools), [Variables](#variables), and [Grids](#grids).

#### Optional Headers

CMR-GraphQL supports a few optional headers that can be used for various features and debugging purposes.

##### Authentication

CMR-GraphQL accepts [Earthdata Login (EDL)](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) tokens via the `Authorization` header. If provided, this token will be provided to any CMR call made as part of the query. CMR-GraphQL will return errors if the token is invalid or expired in which case the client will need to handle the response accordingly.

##### Identification

In order for us to best provide debugging, statistics, and to inform us of future feature work CMR-GraphQL accepts the `Client-Id` header that allows all clients to identifiy themselves. If provided, this value is passed to any CMR call made as part of the query and is used to determine usage patterns, helps debug issues by filtering down logs, and also will help determine priority of feature requests.

##### Request Tracking

Logging is key to debugging, and to ensure that we can provide the best support to users' when issues may arise, CMR-GraphQL supports the `X-Request-Id` header. This header will be passed to any CMR call made as part of the query which will be prepended to any CMR logs that are generated as a result of a query. This value is also used in CMR-GraphQL logs so that we can associate our logs, CMR logs, and any logs you may have if debugging becomes necessary. We recommend setting this value with all requests in the event it is needed, it cannot be added retroactively.

#### Queries

When querying for multiple items there are three high level parameters that can be provided, `count`, `cursor`, `facets` and `items`.

##### Count

`count` will hold the value returned from the CMR header `CMR-Hits` for the respective concept type providing the total number of results (ignoring the current page size).

##### Cursor

`cursor` tells CMR-GraphQL that you'd like to fetch the search after identifier out of the response header with the intent of harvesting data (or fetching multiple pages of results). To take advantage of the cursor you can then include it in subsequent queries until no data is returned.

###### First Request:

    {
      concept {
        count
        cursor
        items {
          conceptId
        }
      }
    }

Which will return something similar to the following:

    {
      "data": {
        "concept": {
          "count": 2483,
          "cursor": "eyJqc29uIjoiLTQ2OTA0MDY3NyJ9=",
          "items": [
            {
              "conceptId": "C1000000001-EXAMPLE"
            },
            ...
        }
      }
    }

###### Subsequent Requests

    {
      concept(cursor: "eyJqc29uIjoiLTQ2OTA0MDY3NyJ9=") {
        count
        cursor
        items {
          conceptId
        }
      }
    }

A couple of things to keep in mind when using a cursor

1. Subsequent queries **require** that the same search parameters are sent to ensure that the same query is performed.
2. Subsequent queries must be made **sequentially** (as of August 21, 2020) as the version of Elastic Search CMR uses does not support parallel queries using the same cursor value.

When all results have been returned, the response will be an empty array and the `cursor` will return a value of `null`.

##### Facets

`facets` will return the data provided by CMR determined by which facets you requested in your query. In order for this data to be provided by CMR you will need to include the `includeFacets` parameter in your query. For more information regarding facets refer to the [CMR documentation](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#facets). See below for a basic example:

    {
      collections(
        includeFacets:"v2"
      ) {
        facets
        items {
          conceptId
        }
      }
    }

##### Items

`items` is where you will provide the columns you'd like returned from CMR.

    {
      concept {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
        }
      }
    }

If you're querying single objects `count` is not available and therefore `items` isn't necessary -- you can simply list the columns you'd like returned from CMR as a direct child of your query.

    {
      concept {
        conceptId
      }
    }

Note that the response you get will match the structure of your query, meaning that in the event you've requested data from a list query you'll receive the results in an `items` array whereas with a single query request you will not.


#### Collections

A subset of supported arguments will automatically be sent to immediately adjacent granule queries, for a list of those arguments see [Passthrough Arguments](#passthrough-arguments).

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/collection.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      collection(conceptId:"C1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        title
        granules {
          count
          items {
            conceptId
            title
          }
        }
        services {
          count
          items {
            conceptId
            type
          }
        }
        tools {
          count
          items {
            conceptId
            supportedBrowsers
          }
        }
        variables {
          count
          items {
            conceptId
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      collections(
        conceptId:["C1000000001-EXAMPLE", "C1000000002-EXAMPLE"]
      ) {
        count
        items {
          title
          granules {
            count
            title
          }
          services {
            count
            items {
              conceptId
              type
            }
          }
          tools {
            count
            items {
              conceptId
              supportedBrowsers
            }
          }
          variables {
            count
            items {
              conceptId
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Granules

For performance reasons, CMR requires that a collection be provided in order to query granules. While CMR supports multiple aliases for the collection CMR-GraphQL requires that it be called `collectionConceptId`; if this is not provided CMR will return an error. We don't enforce this in the schema because you can also use `conceptId` if you're looking for specific granules and schemas don't offer a means of offering conditional validations.

##### Passthrough Arguments

A subset of the supported arguments for [Collections](#collections) will be passed through to the granule query by default. Those arguments are as follows:

- boundingBox
- circle
- point
- polygon
- temporal

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/granule.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      granule(conceptId:"G1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        title
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      granules(collectionConceptId:"G1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        items {
          conceptId
          title
        }
      }
    }


#### Services

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/service.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      service(conceptId:"S1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        type
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      services {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
          type
          description
        }
      }
    }


#### Subscriptions

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/subscription.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      subscription(conceptId:"SUB1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        nativeId
        query
      }
    }

*To also retrieve details pertaining to the associated collection:*

    {
      subscription(conceptId:"SUB1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        nativeId
        query
        collection {
          title
        }
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      subscriptions {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
          query
        }
      }
    }

*To also retrieve details pertaining to the associated collections:*

    {
      subscriptions {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
          query
          collection {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    }

##### Mutations

##### Creating a Subscription

If no `nativeId` is provided, CMR-GraphQL will generate a GUID and supply it.

    mutation {
      createSubscription(
        collectionConceptId: "C1000000001-EXAMPLE"
        name: "Example Subscription"
        query: "polygon=-18,-78,-13,-74,-16,-73,-22,-77,-18,-78"
        subscriberId: "username"
      ) {
        conceptId
        revisionId
      }
    }

To set the `nativeId` to a desired value, simply provide it as an argument and it will be used.

    mutation {
      createSubscription(
        collectionConceptId: "C1000000001-EXAMPLE"
        name: "Example Subscription"
        nativeId: "SUPPLIED-NATIVE-ID"
        query: "polygon=-18,-78,-13,-74,-16,-73,-22,-77,-18,-78"
        subscriberId: "username"
      ) {
        conceptId
        revisionId
      }
    }

##### Updating a Subscription

CMR defines a record as unique based on the `nativeId`, in order to update a subscription supply a `nativeId` that belongs an existing record.

    mutation {
      updateSubscription(
        collectionConceptId: "C1000000001-EXAMPLE"
        name: "Example Subscription"
        nativeId: "EXISTING-NATIVE-ID"
        query: "polygon=-18,-78,-13,-74,-16,-73,-22,-77,-18,-78"
        subscriberId: "username"
      ) {
        conceptId
        revisionId
      }
    }

**NOTES**:

  - Due to the way in which CMR works, `createSubscription` and `updateSubscription` will operate identically when supplying an existing `nativeId` however, this may not always be the case so we encourage you to use the explicit `updateSubscription` mutation noted below.

##### Deleting a Subscription

CMR defines a record as unique based on the `nativeId`, in order to delete a subscription supply a `nativeId` that belongs an existing record.

    mutation {
      deleteSubscription(
        conceptId: "SUB1000000001-EXAMPLE"
        nativeId: "EXISTING-NATIVE-ID"
      ) {
        conceptId
        revisionId
      }
    }

#### Tools

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/tool.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      tool(conceptId:"T1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        scienceKeywords
        supportedBrowsers
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      tools {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
          toolKeywords
          supportedBrowsers
        }
      }
    }

#### Variables

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/variable.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      variable(conceptId:"V1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        scienceKeywords
        variableType
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      variables {
        count
        items {
          conceptId
          scienceKeywords
          variableType
        }
      }
    }

#### Grids

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/grid.graphql).

##### Example Queries

###### Single

    {
      grid(conceptId:"GRD1000000001-EXAMPLE") {
        conceptId
        title
      }
    }

###### Multiple

    {
      grids {
        items {
          conceptId
          name
          longName
          description
        }
      }
    }


#### Related Collections

For all supported arguments and columns, see [the schema](src/types/collection.graphql).

CMR-GraphQL queries CMR's GraphDB in order to find related collections on supported fields. These related collections can be returned as part of the Collection type response.

`relatedCollections` will return related collections, with those collections that share the most relationships first

We use [GraphQL interfaces](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces) in order to return the different relationship types as siblings in the return object.

##### Example Queries

    {
      conceptId
      relatedCollections (
        limit: 1
      ) {
        count
        items {
          id
          title
          doi
          relationships {
            relationshipType
            ... on GraphDbProject {
              name
            }
            ... on GraphDbPlatformInstrument {
              platform
              instrument
            }
            ... on GraphDbRelatedUrl {
              url
              description
              type
              subtype
            }
          }
        }
      }

##### Example Response

    {
      "conceptId": "C1200400842-GHRC",
      "relatedCollections": {
        "count": 18,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": "C1200400792-GHRC",
            "title": "Infrared Global Geostationary Composite Demo 4",
            "doi": "10.5067/GHRC/AMSU-A/DATA303",
            "relationships": [
              {
                "relationshipType": "platformInstrument",
                "platform": "MTSAT-1R",
                "instrument": "VISSR"
              },
              {
                "relationshipType": "relatedUrl",
                "url": "https://doi.org/10.5067/9LNYIYOBNBR5",
                "description": "Another Related URL for Demo",
                "type": "VIEW RELATED INFORMATION",
                "subtype": "DATA RECIPE"
              },
              {
                "relationshipType": "project",
                "name": "Project2"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

#### Local graph database:

Normally running graphQl with `serverless offline` will utilize the `(cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/graphdb)` endpoint, to query against related collections and duplicate collections in the graph database. To send queries to a locally running graph database

We can use a docker gremlin-server that exposes an HTTP endpoint. This is launched by running
docker run -it -p 8182:8182 tinkerpop/gremlin-server conf gremlin-server-rest-modern.yaml
as well as altering the `gremlinPath` in `(src/utils/cmrGraphDb.js)` to the localhost address the gremlin server is running on.

We may add data to this local graph database with http POST requests to the gremlin-server
